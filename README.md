## Description of Page Building 
* Build a pseudocode to develope a general idea of what do we need, why do we need it, and how to we tackle the task
* Use provided code and add a javascript files to it to make the page function
* Link html files with javascript files 
* Create names for variables that hold different values 
* Provide promps and alerts for user input
  <ul> Acceptance Criteria
  <li> Length: 8-128 characters </li>
  <li> Character choices: lower case, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters </li>
  </ul> 
* Construct conditional staments to perfom different actions for different input

* Use funciton generate password and math.random to generate passwords randomly
  Password result should meet user's choice of lenght and character choices 
* Display password result in card body

## Code Snippet
Apply conditional statement if and else to to perform different actions for different iput 
```javascript
if (8 > passwordLength || passwordLength > 128) {
      alert ("Please choose between number 8 to 128")
  } 
  else { generatePassword ()

Apply objects, keys, properties, and method to list out character choices

Use Math.random function to generate a random password that includes user's criteria choices 
```javascript
 for (var i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++) {
      passWordResult += charactersBase[Math.floor(Math.random() * charactersBase.length)]
    }
    return passWordResult
```
Use function to display password result in the answer box 

```javascript

 function writePassword() {
    var password = generatePassword();
    var passwordText = document.querySelector("#password");
    passwordText.value = password;
  }
