## Acceptance Criteria (to be commented out)

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```
  


## Code Snippet
Apply condition statement if and else to to perform different actions for different iput 
```javascript
if (8 > passwordLength || passwordLength > 128) {
      alert ("Please choose between number 8 to 128")
  } 
  else { generatePassword () 
  }
```
Apply objects, keys, properties, and method to list out character choices 
```javascript
charactersChoices = {
  lowerCase:[], upperCase:[], number[], specialCharacters
}

```

Use Math.random function to generate a random password that includes user's criteria choices 
```javascript
 for (var i = 0; i < passwordLength; i++) {
      passWordResult += charactersBase[Math.floor(Math.random() * charactersBase.length)]
    }
    return passWordResult

```
Use function to display password result in the answer box 

```javascript

 function writePassword() {
    var password = generatePassword();
    var passwordText = document.querySelector("#password");
    passwordText.value = password;
  }
```
